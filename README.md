## [🎯 Features](#features)

* 🚀 **Fast**. First class support for statistical sampling. Near-GIPS full-system server simulation.
* 🕰 **Timing-First**. 70 KIPS cycle-accurate simulation.
* 🗂️ **Components-based**. Create custom components.
* ✨ **Free**. QFlex is completely free and open source.


## [🚀 Getting started](#getting-started)

More information regarding the build system and other subsystem of
QFlex can be found in the [documentation](https://parsa-epfl.github.io/qflex/quickstart/).

### 1. Tools

The following tools should be installed to start QFlex

- [Python, pip](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.9
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### 2. Clone repositories
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/parsa-epfl/qflex.git
```

### 3. Install uv for the python requirements
The CLI's Python dependencies are locked in `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock` and managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
Install uv once (e.g. `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`, or `nix profile install nixpkgs#uv`),
then run the CLI from the repository root. Its shebang runs it through uv, and the first run creates `.venv` from the lock file:
```sh
cd qflex
./qflex --help
```
Inside the Docker image the environment is already installed, so `./qflex` works directly.


### 4. Start the docker image

```sh
uv run ./dep --start-docker --worm
```

### 5. Show the help from QFlex cli inside the docker image
```sh
./qflex --help
```

### 6. Follow the quick start guide
Follow the quick start on our documentation page: [Quick Start Guide](https://parsa-epfl.github.io/qflex/quickstart/). The guide will help you start your workload and study it using QFlex. It will also help you understand how statistical sampling helps with both accuracy and speed and how to use it within QFlex.
