## [üéØ Features](#features)

* üï∞ **Timing-First**. 70 KIPS cycle-accurate simulation.
* üóÇÔ∏è **Components-based**. Create custom components.
* ‚ú® **Free**. QFlex is completely free and open source.


## [üöÄ Getting started](#getting-started)

More information regarding the build system and other subsystem of
QFlex can be found in the `docs`.

### 1. Tools

The following packages should be installed to build QFlex

- [GNU Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) >= 13.1
- [cmake](https://cmake.org)
- [conan](https://conan.io)
- [meson](https://mesonbuild.com)

### 2. Clone repositories
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/parsa-epfl/qflex
```

### 3. Build QEMU

```sh
./build cq
```

### 4. Build Flexus
```sh
 conan profile detect #One time only
./build semikraken
./build knottykraken
```

### 5. Create symlinks
```sh
ln -s qemu/build/aarch64-softmmu/qemu-system-aarch64 qemu-aarch64
```

### 6. Add Images

[Download a simple image](https://github.com/parsa-epfl/qflex/releases/latest/) and place it the
repository root location.

```sh
wget https://github.com/parsa-epfl/qflex/releases/latest/download/images.tar.xz
tar -xvf images.tar.xz
```

The repository tree under images folder should look like this.

```
images/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ busybox
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Busybox
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Image
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rootfs.ext4
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rootfs.qcow2
```

### 7. Run
```sh
./runq images/bb # run a bare QEMU emulation
./runq images/bb-timing # run knottykraken release version
```
The filesystem now contains basic tools provided by `/bin/busybox` like `ls`, `cd`, etc.
